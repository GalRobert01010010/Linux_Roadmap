1. Linux Fundamentals

> Introduction to Linux:
    Understanding the Linux operating system, its architecture, and ecosystem

What is Linux?
  Open-source Unix-like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991
  Forms the base of many distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Arch
  Powers servers, supercomputers, Android devices, and embedded systems
  Free to use, modify, and distribute under GPL license

Linux Architecture
  Kernel: Core component managing hardware, memory, processes, and system calls
  Shell: Command-line interface (bash, zsh, fish etc.) for user interaction
    - bash (Bourne Again SHell): The most widely used default shell; known for its versatility and script compatibility.
    - zsh (Z Shell): Highly customizable with advanced tab completion, globbing, and "Oh My Zsh" framework support.
    - fish (Friendly Interactive SHell): User-centric with syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and a web-based configuration tool.
    - sh (Bourne Shell): The original Unix shell; minimalist and used primarily for basic system recovery and scripts.
    - ksh (KornShell): Combines features of the Bourne shell (sh) and C shell (csh); favored in enterprise and legacy Unix environments.
    - csh (C Shell): Uses syntax similar to the C programming language; 
    - dash (Debian Almquist Shell): A lightweight, POSIX-compliant shell used in Debian/Ubuntu for fast system booting.
  System Libraries: Provide functions for applications (glibc, etc.)
    - glibc (GNU Library for C): The essential wrapper for system calls; defines standard functions like open(), read(), and malloc().
    - musl: A lightweight, fast, and simple C library; often used in embedded systems or minimal distributions like Alpine Linux.
    - libstdc++: The standard C++ library; provides core functionality for applications written in C++.
    - openssl: Provides robust cryptographic functions and protocols (SSL/TLS) for secure communication and data encryption.
    - zlib: A foundational library for data compression used by many system tools and applications.
    - libpthread: Implements POSIX threads for multi-threaded application execution and management.
  System Utilities: Essential tools and programs (ls, cp, grep, etc.)
  Desktop Environment: Optional GUI layer (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
    - GNOME: Focused on modern design, simplicity, and a workflow-oriented interface; default for many major distros.
    - KDE Plasma: Highly flexible and customizable; offers a traditional "Windows-like" layout with powerful integrated tools.
    - XFCE: Lightweight and stable; designed for performance and low resource usage without sacrificing functionality.
    - MATE: A continuation of the classic GNOME 2 interface; provides a traditional, intuitive desktop experience.
    - Cinnamon: Developed for Linux Mint; balances modern features with a traditional, familiar desktop layout.

Popular Distributions
  Ubuntu/Debian: User-friendly, large community, apt package manager
  CentOS/RHEL/Fedora: Enterprise-focused, yum/dnf package manager
  Arch Linux: Rolling release, minimal base, pacman package manager
  openSUSE: YaST configuration tool, zypper package manager

Key Differences from Windows
  Case-sensitive filesystem (File.txt ≠ file.txt)
  Forward slashes for paths (/home/user) vs backslashes (C:\Users)
  No drive letters - everything under root directory /
  Package managers instead of .exe installers
  Text-based configuration files in /etc instead of registry

> Filesystem Hierarchy:
    Understanding Linux directory structure and file organization

Root Directory Structure
  / - Root directory, top of filesystem hierarchy
  /home - User home directories (/home/username)
  /root - Home directory for root user
  /etc - System configuration files
  /var - Variable data (logs, databases, web content)
  /usr - User programs and data (read-only)
  /bin - Essential user command binaries
  /sbin - System administration binaries
  /tmp - Temporary files (cleared on reboot)
  /opt - Optional third-party software
  /dev - Device files (hard drives, terminals)
  /proc - Virtual filesystem for process information
  /sys - Virtual filesystem for kernel/hardware info

File Types
  Regular files (-): Normal files containing data
  Directories (d): Folders containing other files
  Symbolic links (l): Shortcuts pointing to other files
  Character devices (c): Serial devices like terminals
  Block devices (b): Storage devices like hard drives
  Sockets (s): Inter-process communication
  Named pipes (p): FIFO special files

Permissions System
  Three permission types: read (r/4), write (w/2), execute (x/1)
  Three user categories: owner, group, others
  Example: -rwxr-xr-- means owner:rwx, group:r-x, others:r--
  chmod 755 file = rwxr-xr-x (owner full, others read+execute)
  chmod u+x file = add execute permission for owner
  chown user:group file = change owner and group
  Special permissions: SUID (4), SGID (2), Sticky bit (1)

Path Types
  Absolute path: Starts from root (/) - /home/user/documents/file.txt
  Relative path: From current directory - documents/file.txt or ../file.txt
  . represents current directory
  .. represents parent directory
  ~ represents user home directory
  - represents previous directory (cd -)

> Essential Commands:
    Core commands for navigation and file manipulation

Navigation Commands
  pwd - Print working directory (shows current location)
  cd /path - Change directory to absolute path
  cd .. - Go up one directory level
  cd ~ or cd - Go to home directory
  cd - - Go to previous directory
  ls - List directory contents
  ls -l - Long format with permissions, owner, size, date
  ls -a - Show hidden files (starting with .)
  ls -lh - Human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB)
  ls -R - Recursive listing of subdirectories

File Operations
  touch file.txt - Create empty file or update timestamp
  mkdir directory - Create new directory
  mkdir -p path/to/dir - Create nested directories
  cp source dest - Copy file
  cp -r dir1 dir2 - Copy directory recursively
  mv source dest - Move or rename file/directory
  rm file - Delete file
  rm -r directory - Delete directory recursively
  rm -f file - Force delete without confirmation
  rmdir directory - Remove empty directory

Viewing File Content
  cat file - Display entire file content
  cat file1 file2 - Concatenate multiple files
  less file - View file with scrolling (q to quit)
  more file - View file page by page
  head file - Show first 10 lines
  head -n 20 file - Show first 20 lines
  tail file - Show last 10 lines
  tail -f file - Follow file updates in real-time (logs)
  wc file - Count lines, words, characters
  wc -l file - Count only lines

Search Commands
  find /path -name 'pattern' - Search files by name
  find . -type f -name '*.txt' - Find all .txt files
  find /home -user john - Find files owned by user
  find . -mtime -7 - Files modified in last 7 days
  locate filename - Fast search using database
  updatedb - Update locate database (run as root)
  which command - Show path of executable
  whereis command - Show binary, source, manual locations
